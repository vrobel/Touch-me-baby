Touch.me.baby
================

Touch.me.baby is a library for ActionScript 3 with basic gesture recognition and unified Mouse/Touch handling.

So far you can find here Drag and Pinch gestures.

To run just compile class RunTest in src. Add swc from libs. I also attached swf + apk so you can quickly preview it (APK requires Adobe AIR installed)

PS. Sorry for lack of consistency about capital letters. 1 year with C# only changed my habits a bit.
